The number of students seeking mental health support while studying at university has increased by more than 50% in five years, BBC Shared Data Unit analysis suggests.

The BBC asked universities across the UK via FOIs for the numbers of students seeking some form of support.

Of 83 universities that provided five years of full data from 2012 to 2017, the number of students seeking help rose from 50,900 to 78,100. The number of students going to university dropped slightly over the same period.

At the same time, budgets towards mental health services increased by more than 40%.
