Hi
 
Please see my request for the information below which I’m submitting as a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ("FoI").
 
Could you please provide information for each year from 2012 to 2018 for the following:
 
1. Number of staff assigned to assist students with mental health issues or working within mental health in pastoral care departments – please break down numbers of staff by job type eg therapist/counsellor 
 
2. Details of the number and nature of university services to help students with mental health issues ie counselling, psychologist, therapists, peer support
 
3. Budgets for providing mental health support for students 
 
4. Numbers of students seeking support for mental health issues - how many students were still waiting to get treatment for mental health issues at year end and how many accessed treatment during the year
 
5. How long on average a student had to wait before they were able to access help
 
6. Please supply the following demographic information for students seeking help - I have no interest in identifying individuals but would like the total number of students within each category if it is not too small to examine potential trends:
 
A.      Gender – male, female, other, trans 
B.      Age
C.      Year of study ie first year, second year
D.      Course type ie undergrad, masters, PhD
E.      Was the student from a state school?
F.      Socio-economic background
 
Could you please send the requested information in a table in one tab of a spreadsheet/Excel/.xlsx file/.csv file
 
If you can’t answer all of my questions and need further information, please call me as soon as possible to discuss what information your university has available on +44 (0)121 567 7057. 
 
Please acknowledge this FOI request by reply with a reference on receipt.
 
If the information requested is currently in the public domain, or if you have published a similar response, please let me know where I can find it. If you have published some of the requested information already but not all of it, can you please send me what has already been published and fill in the gaps by reply?
 
If you can’t provide all of this information, please send what information you can in the spirit of Section 16 of FoI, to “provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so, to persons who propose to make, or have made requests for information”.
 
Please send me the information by email with a summary of the information I’ve requested.
 
I look forward to hearing from you promptly within the statutory time limit of 20 working days from your receipt of this email.
 
Whilst writing, I take this opportunity to remind you of the Information Commissioner's public statements, in which he has stated that there is a "presumption of disclosure" under FoI.
 
Please note that if this request for FoI disclosure is refused, I reserve the right to take up the matter with the Information Commissioner and/or to pursue all legal avenues of appeal.  I trust this will not be necessary.
 
Thanks in advance for your help.
